## üë§ Manual Testing

### Test Case 1: Basic Conversation Loop
1. [ ] Open http://localhost:5001
2. [ ] Hold microphone button 2+ seconds
3. [ ] Say "–ê—Ç–ª–∞—Å" ‚Üí hear "—Ç–∞–∫, —à–µ—Ñ–µ"
4. [ ] IMMEDIATELY say request (don't wait for TTS to finish)
5. [ ] Atlas responds with TTS
6. [ ] **VERIFY:** Recording starts AUTOMATICALLY (no "–ê—Ç–ª–∞—Å" needed)
7. [ ] Continue dialogue
8. [ ] **VERIFY:** Loop works continuously

### Test Case 2: Pending Message Flow
1. [ ] Hold mic button 2+ seconds
2. [ ] Say "–ê—Ç–ª–∞—Å" during activation TTS playback
3. [ ] Immediately speak request (before activation TTS finishes)
4. [ ] **VERIFY:** Console shows "Queueing message"
5. [ ] Wait for activation TTS to finish
6. [ ] **VERIFY:** Console shows "Sending pending message"
7. [ ] **VERIFY:** Console shows "Pending message is DUPLICATE"
8. [ ] **VERIFY:** Console shows "Starting continuous listening"
9. [ ] **VERIFY:** Recording starts automatically

### Test Case 3: Multiple Turns
1. [ ] Start conversation with "–ê—Ç–ª–∞—Å"
2. [ ] Ask question 1 ‚Üí Atlas responds
3. [ ] **VERIFY:** Auto-recording starts
4. [ ] Ask question 2 ‚Üí Atlas responds
5. [ ] **VERIFY:** Auto-recording starts
6. [ ] Ask question 3 ‚Üí Atlas responds
7. [ ] **VERIFY:** Auto-recording starts
8. [ ] **VERIFY:** NO need to say "–ê—Ç–ª–∞—Å" between questions

## üìä Console Log Verification

Expected log pattern:
```
[CONVERSATION] üéØ Keyword detected
[TTS] Audio playback completed {isActivationResponse: true}
[CONVERSATION] ‚ö†Ô∏è Cannot send message - chat is still streaming
[CONVERSATION] ‚è≥ Queueing message: "..."
[TTS] Audio playback completed {isActivationResponse: false}
[CONVERSATION] üì§ Sending pending message: "..."
[CONVERSATION] ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending message is DUPLICATE - starting continuous listening
[CONVERSATION] üîÑ Starting continuous listening ‚Üê CRITICAL!
```

- [ ] All log messages present
- [ ] No error messages
- [ ] Continuous listening starts after pending
