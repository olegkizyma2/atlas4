- ✅ Verification scripts in one place (`tests/`)
- ✅ Each directory has README for quick reference

### Maintainability:
- ✅ Clear structure for future additions
- ✅ Reduced clutter in root
- ✅ Consistent naming and organization
- ✅ No duplicate or obsolete files

## 🔍 Quick Navigation

### For Developers:
```bash
# Find all fixes
ls docs/fixes/

# Find PR documentation
ls docs/pull-requests/

# Find verification scripts
ls tests/verify-*.sh
```

### For Documentation:
```bash
# Read fix index
cat docs/fixes/README.md

# Read PR index
cat docs/pull-requests/README.md

# Read main docs index
cat docs/README.md
```

---

## 🎯 Verification

### Check Root is Clean:
```bash
ls *.md
# Should show only: README.md, log-web.md
```

### Check Subdirectories Exist:
```bash
ls -d docs/fixes docs/pull-requests
# Should show both directories
```

### Check Files Moved:
```bash
ls docs/fixes/*.md | wc -l
# Should show 16 (15 files + README)

ls docs/pull-requests/*.md | wc -l
# Should show 3 (2 PRs + README)

ls tests/verify-*.sh | wc -l
# Should show 4+ verification scripts
```

---

## 📋 Future Guidelines

### Adding New Fix Documentation:
1. Create detailed report in `docs/` (if technical deep dive needed)
2. Create summary in `docs/fixes/` (always)
3. Update `docs/fixes/README.md` with new entry
4. Create verification script in `tests/` (if applicable)

### Adding New PR:
1. Create PR summary in `docs/pull-requests/`
2. Link to related fix documentation in `docs/fixes/`
3. Update `docs/pull-requests/README.md`

### Keeping Root Clean:
- ✅ DO: Keep only README.md, log-web.md, restart_system.sh, verify-fixes.sh
- ❌ DON'T: Add temporary summaries, fix reports, or PR docs to root
- ✅ DO: Use appropriate subdirectories from the start
