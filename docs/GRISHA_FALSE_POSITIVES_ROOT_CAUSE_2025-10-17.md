# Grisha Verification False Positives - Root Cause Analysis
**Date:** 17.10.2025, ~01:00  
**Reporter:** User (via logs investigation)  
**Priority:** CRITICAL ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üî¥ Problem Summary

**User Report:**

**Translation:** Incorrect execution happening - nothing performed except browser opening. Why did Grisha verify it as completed?

**System Claim:** Items 1-4 all verified as ‚úÖ VERIFIED  
**Reality:** Only Item 1 (browser opening) actually worked  
**Gap:** 75% false positive rate (3 out of 4 failed items marked as successful)

---

## üîç Root Cause Identified

### Primary Issue: Tool Execution Success != Actual Task Success

**The core problem:** `mcpManager.executeTool()` returns a result when the tool **executes without throwing an exception**, but this does NOT mean the task actually succeeded.

#### Example from logs:

```javascript
// Item 2: "Enter '–•–∞—Ç—ñ–∫–æ' in search box"
Tool call: playwright_fill({ selector: '[name="q"]', value: '–•–∞—Ç—ñ–∫–æ' })
                ‚Üì
MCP Playwright executes (no exception thrown)
                ‚Üì
Returns: { content: [...], isError: false } OR similar structure
                ‚Üì
System marks: success: true ‚úÖ
                ‚Üì
Reality: Element '[name="q"]' may NOT exist ‚Üí nothing filled
```

**Key insight from code:**

```javascript
// orchestrator/ai/mcp-manager.js:125
if (message.error) {
    resolver.reject(new Error(message.error.message || 'MCP tool error'));
} else {
    resolver.resolve(message.result); // ‚ö†Ô∏è THIS ALWAYS SUCCEEDS IF NO ERROR
}
```

**The assumption:** No error = success  
**The reality:** Playwright can return result even when:
- Selector doesn't match any elements
- Element is not interactable
- Navigation didn't load expected page
- Click didn't trigger expected action

---

### Secondary Issue: Missing Success Metrics

**Found in logs:**
```
[STAGE-2.2-MCP]   Success: ‚úÖ
[STAGE-2.2-MCP]   Successful calls: 0  ‚Üê WHY ZERO?
[STAGE-2.2-MCP]   Failed calls: 0      ‚Üê WHY ZERO?
[STAGE-2.2-MCP]   ‚úÖ playwright__playwright_click
```

**Root cause:** `executeTools()` in `mcp-todo-manager.js` did NOT count successful/failed calls.

**Fixed:** Added counting logic (lines ~1054-1056):
```javascript
const successful_calls = results.filter(r => r.success).length;
const failed_calls = results.filter(r => !r.success).length;
```

**However:** This only counts exception-based failures, NOT task-level failures.

---

### Tertiary Issue: Grisha Verification Methodology

**What Grisha does:**
1. Plans verification tools (usually `playwright_navigate` + `execute_command` for screenshot)
2. Executes verification tools
3. Analyzes results with gpt-4o-mini
4. Always returns ‚úÖ VERIFIED

**Why it fails:**
- **Screenshot verification:** Grisha takes screenshot AFTER execution, but doesn't validate WHAT'S in the screenshot
- **LLM analysis:** gpt-4o-mini analyzes metadata (tool succeeded, no exceptions) rather than actual browser state
- **No negative tests:** Grisha doesn't check for expected failures (e.g., "form should NOT be filled if element missing")

**Example from Item 4 logs:**
```
[TODO] üîß Grisha calling playwright_navigate on playwright
[TODO] ‚úÖ Grisha tool playwright_navigate succeeded
[TODO] üîß Grisha calling run_shell_command on shell
ERROR Grisha tool run_shell_command failed: Tool 'run_shell_command' not available
                                              ‚Üì
                                        (should be 'execute_command')
[TODO] üîß Verification tools executed: PARTIAL
                                              ‚Üì
[TODO] üß† Grisha analysis: ‚úÖ VERIFIED  ‚Üê DESPITE PARTIAL EXECUTION!
```

**Why it passed despite partial verification:**
- gpt-4o-mini saw: "1 tool executed successfully, and 2 checks were performed"
- This is technically true (navigate succeeded), but doesn't validate actual task completion
- Screenshot tool failed (wrong name), so no visual verification occurred

---

## üìä Evidence from Logs

### Item 1: "Open browser on Google page"
- **Execution:** `playwright_navigate({ url: 'https://www.google.com' })`
- **Result:** Succeeded ‚úÖ (page loaded)
- **Verification:** `execute_command` (shell), checked process + browser state
- **Verdict:** ‚úÖ CORRECTLY VERIFIED (user confirmed it worked)

### Item 2: "Enter '–•–∞—Ç—ñ–∫–æ' in search box"
- **Execution:** `playwright_fill({ selector: '[name="q"]', value: '–•–∞—Ç—ñ–∫–æ' })` + `playwright_click({ selector: 'button[type="submit"]' })`
- **Result:** Both marked successful (no exceptions)
- **Reality:** User reports it DIDN'T work
- **Probable cause:** Selectors `[name="q"]` or `button[type="submit"]` didn't match Google's actual DOM structure
- **Verification:** Grisha navigated to page, analyzed metadata, said ‚úÖ
- **Verdict:** ‚ùå FALSE POSITIVE

### Item 3: "Find link to watch Hachiko movie"
- **Execution:** `playwright_get_visible_text` + `playwright_click({ selector: 'a:has-text("–¥–∏–≤–∏—Ç–∏—Å—è –æ–Ω–ª–∞–π–Ω")' })`
- **Result:** Marked successful
- **Reality:** User reports it DIDN'T work
- **Probable cause:** Text "–¥–∏–≤–∏—Ç–∏—Å—è –æ–Ω–ª–∞–π–Ω" may not exist on search results page
- **Verification:** Grisha checked browser state, said ‚úÖ
- **Verdict:** ‚ùå FALSE POSITIVE

### Item 4: "Open link for movie viewing"
- **Execution:** `playwright_click({ selector: 'a[href*="watch"]' })`
- **Result:** Marked successful
- **Reality:** User reports it DIDN'T work
- **Probable cause:** No link with 'watch' in href at that point (previous steps failed)
- **Verification:** Grisha tried to screenshot (failed due to wrong tool name), still said ‚úÖ
- **Verdict:** ‚ùå FALSE POSITIVE

### Item 5: "Expand video to fullscreen"
- **Status:** Verification in progress when logs ended
- **Planned:** `playwright_click({ selector: '.fullscreen-button' })`
- **Expected:** Will probably mark successful even if button doesn't exist

## üéØ Why This Is Critical

1. **Cascading failures:** Each item builds on previous ones. When Item 2 fails but is marked successful, Items 3-5 are attempting impossible tasks.

2. **User trust:** System appears confident (‚úÖ VERIFIED) but produces zero results. This destroys user confidence.

3. **No recovery:** System doesn't retry because it believes tasks succeeded.

4. **Debugging difficulty:** Logs show "success" everywhere, making it hard to identify actual failures without manual testing.

5. **Resource waste:** LLM API calls, TTS generation, verification tools all execute for fake successes.

---

## üí° Solutions Required

### 1. **Enhanced Execution Result Validation** (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** MCP tools return results without success/failure indicators.

**Solution:** Add validation layer in `executeTools()`:

```javascript
// After: const result = await this.mcpManager.executeTool(...)

// Validate Playwright-specific results
if (toolCall.server === 'playwright') {
    const isValid = this._validatePlaywrightResult(toolCall.tool, result, parameters);
    
    if (!isValid) {
        throw new Error(`Playwright tool ${toolCall.tool} completed but validation failed`);
    }
}

// Validate other server types
if (toolCall.server === 'filesystem') {
    // Check file actually created/exists
}
```

**Validation checks:**
- `playwright_fill`: Verify element was found and filled
- `playwright_click`: Verify element was found and clickable
- `playwright_navigate`: Verify page loaded (check URL or title)
- `playwright_get_visible_text`: Verify text actually returned (not empty)

---

### 2. **Playwright Return Value Analysis** (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Problem:** We don't know what Playwright MCP actually returns.

**Solution:** Add detailed logging:

```javascript
// In mcp-todo-manager.js executeTools()
const result = await this.mcpManager.executeTool(...);

this.logger.debug('mcp-todo', `[TOOL-RESULT] ${toolCall.tool} returned:`, {
    type: typeof result,
    keys: result ? Object.keys(result) : [],
    isError: result?.isError,
    content: typeof result?.content === 'string' 
        ? result.content.substring(0, 200) 
        : result?.content
});
```

**Then:** Determine what success/failure looks like in Playwright responses.

---

### 3. **Grisha Verification Enhancement** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Grisha analyzes metadata instead of actual results.

**Solution:** Require visual verification:

```javascript
// In grisha_verify_item_optimized.js prompt:

‚ö†Ô∏è –ö–†–ò–¢–ò–ß–ù–û: –ó–ê–í–ñ–î–ò –≤–∏–∫–æ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤—É–π screencapture –¥–ª—è –≤—ñ–∑—É–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—ó –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≤—ñ—Ä–∫–∏!
‚ö†Ô∏è –ó–ê–ë–û–†–û–ù–ï–ù–û –≤–µ—Ä–∏—Ñ—ñ–∫—É–≤–∞—Ç–∏ –¢–Ü–õ–¨–ö–ò –ø–æ metadata!

–û–ë–û–í'–Ø–ó–ö–û–í–Ü –ö–†–û–ö–ò:
1. –ó—Ä–æ–±–∏ screenshot (shell__execute_command –∑ screencapture)
2. –ü–µ—Ä–µ–≤—ñ—Ä —â–æ screenshot —É—Å–ø—ñ—à–Ω–æ —Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–æ
3. –û–ø–∏—à–∏ –©–û –ë–ê–ß–ò–® –Ω–∞ screenshot
4. –ü–æ—Ä—ñ–≤–Ω—è–π –∑ success_criteria
5. –¢–Ü–õ–¨–ö–ò –¢–û–î–Ü –≤—ñ–¥–¥–∞–π –≤–µ—Ä–¥–∏–∫—Ç

–ü–†–ò–ö–õ–ê–î:
- Screenshot: /tmp/verify_item_2.png (—Å—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–æ ‚úÖ)
- –ë–∞—á—É: Google homepage –∑ –ø—É—Å—Ç–æ—é –ø–æ—à—É–∫–æ–≤–æ—é —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–æ—é
- –û—á—ñ–∫—É–≤–∞–ª–æ—Å—å: –§–æ—Ä–º–∞ –∑ —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–æ–º "–•–∞—Ç—ñ–∫–æ"
- –í–µ—Ä–¥–∏–∫—Ç: ‚ùå –ù–ï –í–ò–ö–û–ù–ê–ù–û (—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞ –ø—É—Å—Ç–∞)
```

**Fallback:** If screenshot fails, mark as UNVERIFIED (not verified = assume failed).

---

### 4. **Success Criteria Strengthening** (LOW PRIORITY)

**Problem:** Success criteria too vague ("Search query entered").

**Solution:** Make criteria testable:

```javascript
// Instead of:
success_criteria: "Search query entered"

// Use:
success_criteria: {
    visual: "Google search box contains text '–•–∞—Ç—ñ–∫–æ'",
    technical: "Input element [name='q'] has value='–•–∞—Ç—ñ–∫–æ'",
    behavioral: "Search button is enabled and visible"
}
```

---

## üìà Expected Improvements

### Before Fix:
- False positive rate: **75%** (3/4 items)
- User satisfaction: **0%** (nothing worked except browser open)
- System confidence: **100%** (all marked ‚úÖ)
- Debugging time: **High** (logs say success, reality says failure)

### After Fix (Estimated):
- False positive rate: **<10%** (occasional edge cases)
- User satisfaction: **70-80%** (most tasks actually work)
- System confidence: **Matches reality** (failures logged as failures)
- Debugging time: **Low** (logs accurately reflect failures)

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### 1. **Add Test Case: Known Failing Selector**

```javascript
// Test Item:
{
    action: "Find non-existent element",
    tool_calls: [{
        server: "playwright",
        tool: "playwright_click",
        parameters: { selector: ".this-element-does-not-exist" }
    }],
    success_criteria: "Element clicked successfully"
}

// Expected: 
// - Execution: FAIL (element not found)
// - Verification: FAIL (screenshot shows nothing clicked)
// - Final: Item marked as failed, retry offered
```

### 2. **Add Playwright Response Logging**

Before deploying fixes, capture 10-20 real Playwright responses to understand their structure.

### 3. **Manual Verification**

After fixes, re-run the original user request ("Find Hachiko movie in Google") and verify:
- Each step actually completes in browser
- Screenshots show expected state
- Failures are caught and reported correctly

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Never trust absence of exceptions as proof of success.** Validate actual outcomes.

2. **Metadata is not reality.** Tool executed ‚â† task completed.

3. **Visual verification is king.** Screenshots don't lie; metadata does.

4. **Fail-safe principle:** Assume failure unless proven otherwise, not vice versa.

5. **Test with failures.** System that only tests success cases will have hidden failure modes.

---

**Status:** Root cause identified, first fix applied (counting), major fixes pending.

**Next Action:** Add detailed Playwright response logging to understand return value structures before implementing validation layer.
